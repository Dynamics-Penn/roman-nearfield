## Installation
When you clone this repository you'll need to have Git's [Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com/) extension installed.
Cloning the repo will download only pointers to many of the data files. To actually download them you will need to run
`git lfs checkout`
from within the cloned repo. Once you have run this command one time, you should not have to do anything differently than your normal git workflow unless you add a new large file with an extension not tracked by `git lfs`. See the [LFS wiki](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial) for more about the extension.
